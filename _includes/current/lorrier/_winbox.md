# Connect via Winbox Tools
While most configuration can be done via the LR2 web interface, some things like changing its static IP address or password need to be done via Winbox Tools.

1.  Download the Winbox tools via the links in the [Routerboard configuration guide](https://github.com/lorriercom/lorrier-lr2/blob/master/routeros/routerboard_configuration.md#routerboard-configuration).
2.  Use the **Neighbors** tab to find your LR2:

3.  Enter your login as password and **Connect**.

    > The default login is `admin` and the default password is `lorrier`.
