[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based server and web GUI for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. You can find a lot of example flows and additional nodes in the [Node-RED Library](http://flows.nodered.org/).

With the [Node-RED node for TTN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ttn) it is very easy to process device messages and activations with pretty much no code.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [preview.console.thethingsnetwork.org](https://preview.console.thethingsnetwork.org/).
* Access to an application with registered device on TTN.
* A Node-RED instance or server/computer to install it on.
* Version 1.x of the [Node-RED node for TTN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ttn).

    > You can get version 1.x via the refactor tag:
    > 
    > ```bash
    > npm install node-red-contrib-ttn@refactor
    > ```
