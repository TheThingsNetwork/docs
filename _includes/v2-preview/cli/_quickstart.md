SHA256 checksums for the uncompressed binaries are listed in the [`checksums`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/v2-preview/checksums) file.

The `checksums` file is signed using our GPG key with fingerprint `2F06 2CD1 5425 47AF 71BD  9B81 8FC5 CD2B 9DFB 1B4B`. 
The signature is stored as [`checksums.sig`](https://ttnreleases.blob.core.windows.net/release/v2-preview/checksums).

We often update `ttnctl`, so re-download it once in a while.
