# The Things Uno

> This guide is based on the old [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/) environment. Please migrate to [console.thethingsnetwork.org](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/).

<a href="https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-uno/" target="_blank">The Things Uno</a> is based off the [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro) ([not the Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro#toc9)) with added [Microchip LoRaWAN module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology). It is fully compatible with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and existing shields.

It's the perfect board to start prototyping your IoT ideas or make an existing project wireless with up to 10km range by simply swapping boards.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/).
* The Things Uno beta board.
* Version 0.x of the [The Things Network Arduino Library](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-device-lib).
