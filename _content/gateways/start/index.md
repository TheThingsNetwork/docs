# Where to start

Are you looking to improve the coverage of the Things Network, either for your personal use or to benefit others? You can purchase your own gateway, or start building yours.

## The Things Gateway

[The Things Gateway](../gateway/index.md) is The Things Network's official gateway, following a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/419277966/the-things-network). For €300, you can improve coverage in your area! This is the best option to get started with The Things Network.
