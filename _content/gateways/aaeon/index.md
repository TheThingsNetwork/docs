# AAEON AIOT-ILRA01

The Things Network is building a network for the Internet of Things by creating abundant data connectivity, so applications and businesses can flourish.

In order to facilitate the startup of the complete solution, including AAEON AIOT-ILRA01 LoRaWAN™ Gateway&Network server, a pre-built OS image had been created to connect the gateway to TTN Network Server.
Waiting for the TTN V3 stack, we have included into this image the Semtech UDP packet forwarder.
