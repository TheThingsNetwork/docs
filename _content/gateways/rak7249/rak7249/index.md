## Product Background

The Enterprise Grade [**RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7249-diy-outdoor-gateway) is an ideal product for IoT commercial deployment. It contains the Main Board, Operator-grade waterproof enclosure, backup battery and mounting accessories. The hardware main board completely integrates the **WIFI**, **4G**, **GPS** and **PoE main supply** with an **integrated back-up battery**. The firmware implements a fully featured LoRaWAN™ compliant network base station. The Gateway has a range of over **15 Kilometer line-of-sight** and over **2 Kilometer in dense urban environments**.

The Macro Outdoor Gateway brings more flexibility for the developer to create an enterprise grade solution: our most important difference is our flexible development support structure, allowing for faster development and time to market. We offer both a ready-to-go firmware image for openWRT based platforms and an open SDK for integration into hardware to support the needs of each customer.
