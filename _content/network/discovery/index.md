# Discovery Server
The Discovery Server is the key to the decentralized architecture of The Things Network. This is where routers, brokers and handlers announce themselves and where you can look them up.

## Community endpoints
Use the following endpoints for the community network:

- [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/): `discovery.thethingsnetwork.org:1900`
- HTTP: `http://discovery.thethingsnetwork.org:8080`
