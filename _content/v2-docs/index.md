> **Important note:** This page is containing documentation written for The Things Network using The Things Network Stack (V2). This version of the LoRaWAN network stack is not being developed anymore and will stop being supported around the end of 2021, so this documentation page is outdated. Please consider [migrating your devices and gateways to The Things Stack (V3)](../the-things-stack/migrate-to-v3.md) as soon as possible. 

If you still want to read V2 documentation, you can access it here:
