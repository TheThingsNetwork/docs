Since January 2021, **The Things Network V2 software has been upgraded to The Things Stack Community Edition**. This upgrade comes with a set of brand new features, out-of-the-box integrations, extended coverage and improved user experience. 

The Things Stack Community Edition is one of the distributions of The Things Stack, a third version (V3) of the LoRaWAN Network Server that is developed and actively maintaned by The Things Industries. 

> The Things Stack Community Edition runs on open source code, so if you would like to explore or contribute, visit our [open source LoRaWAN stack repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack).
>
> Click [here](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/download/) to learn about other distributions of The Things Stack.

The Things Stack Community Edition offers a free and developer-friendly way to get familiar with LoRaWAN technology. It provides a public community LoRaWAN network, initiated by [The Things Industries](https://thethingsindustries.com/), and supported by 100k+ The Things Network community members from more than 100 countries around the world.

> Join The Things Network [Forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/) or [Slack](https://thethingsnetwork.slack.com/) for community support.

> For commercial solutions, we recommend using an SLA-backed network provided by The Things Industries. Visit [The Things Industries website](https://thethingsindustries.com/) to learn more about it.

{{< note >}} **The Things Network V2 will no longer be actively maintained and all V2 machines are going to be shut down by the end of 2021**. If you have been using The Things Network V2 previously, you will need to [migrate your gateways and devices to The Things Stack Community Edition]({{< relref "../the-things-stack" >}}). {{</ note >}}

## Learn more about LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a radio frequency protocol that allows devices to connect to the Internet over a long range with incredibly low power consumption. Visit our documentation to [learn more about LoRaWAN]({{< relref "../lorawan" >}}).

Watch the video below on *Everything you need to know about LoRaWAN in 60 minutes* by Johan Stokking (tech lead of The Things Network):

Read along to learn how you can implement your end-to-end IoT prototype within a day.

## Start using The Things Stack Community Edition

The Things Stack Community Edition can be accessed via the Console. You can access the Console by [selecting a cluster](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) that is closest to you geographically.

## Set up your LoRaWAN network

The main building blocks of the public community LoRaWAN network are **gateways**. Thousands of gateways across the globe are already connected to The Things Stack Community Edition, making the community LoRaWAN network available for free usage. 

> See the [global coverage map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map)

Although you might already have coverage in your area, we still recommend you get your hands on a gateway to ensure reliable coverage. There are a lot of gateways with extensive features on the market, so make sure you choose the one that fits your needs best. For example, here is a short list of some popular indoor gateways:

|   |  Gateway | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|

> **Important note:** Different world regions use different [frequency plans](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/reference/frequency-plans/), e.g. 863-870 MHz for Europe, 902-928 MHz for North America, etc. Make sure you double-check that the hardware aligns with your regionâ€™s radio frequency before purchasing!

## Get your development board and activate it

To build a prototype of your end-to-end IoT solution, you will need a development board. Here is a short list of popular development boards that can help you build your IoT app in no-time:
