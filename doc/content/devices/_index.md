The Things Network is the first open source, decentralized infrastructure for the Internet of Things. [The Things Stack Sandbox](https://console.cloud.thethings.network) is free for fair use. Learn how to connect your Things!

Before your device can communicate via The Things Network, you will need to [register]({{< relref "registration" >}}) it.

## Hardware

Currently, The Things Network supports [LoRaWAN](https://www.lora-alliance.org/) for long range (~5 to 15km), low power (months to years on battery), but also low bandwidth (51 bytes/message) communication. We plan to support [multiple Bluetooth Broadcast/Mesh networks](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-technology/topology-options) and other networks as well.

You can of course use [The Things Node]({{< relref "node/" >}}) or [Uno]({{< relref "uno/" >}}), but The Things Network supports any certified LoRaWAN device. The ones you can find under **Hardware** have been tested and documented by us or our users.

## SDKs

To connect a device it needs to have a LoRaWAN module, either on board, as a shield or wired. Most modules can be talked to via a serial interface. To hide you from the complexity of the commands and responses, some modules come with an SDK.

[The Things Node]({{< relref "node/" >}}) and [Uno]({{< relref "uno/" >}}) use the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform and [Microchip RN modules](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology). We've built an [Arduino SDK]({{< relref "arduino/" >}}) which enables you to send a message in just a couple lines of code. We plan to provide SDKs for more IoT platforms as well.
