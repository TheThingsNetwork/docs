## Product Background

The [**RAK7204 LoRa Environmental Sensor**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7204-lora-environmental-sensor) is a LoRaWAN node with integrated environmental sensors. The high-precision environmental sensors, can measure changes in temperature, humidity, gas pressure and provide an indoor air quality index. All the accumulated data can be send to a LoRaWAN Gateway in order for it to be forwarded to the Cloud.

The environmental sensors, LoRa transceiver module, LoRa antenna, and the battery are fitted in a 90 mm x 85 mm x 34 mm sized housing. These small dimensions allow for installation in tight spaces or ones that require the sensor to have a minimal impact on the overall feel of the surrounding environment. The housing adopts a hollow, permeable design to facilitate air flow in order to more accurately detect the environmental changes.

## Product Features
