## Product Background

The [**RAK811 LoRa® Breakout Module**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak811-wisduo-lora-module) is a wireless remote sensor node solution based from RAK811 + MEMS Sensor. The board uses the latest LoRaWAN™ Version 1.0.2 and supports the LoRaWAN™ working mode, making it easier to link into the LoRaWAN™ network.

This node has an expandable sensor interface, which greatly increases the product's application scenarios. It is equipped with advanced 3D acceleration chip that allows faster motion detection. The device has low-power features at stationary, reducing overall consumption and increasing battery life.

Overall, this node has various functionalities and applications designed in single board that could help you develop your own LoRa® Projects.
