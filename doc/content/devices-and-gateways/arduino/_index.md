[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

With [The Things Network Library](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-device-lib) Arduino Boards can communicate via The Things Network. Both [The Things Uno](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/the-things-uno/) and The Things Node are Arduino Boards that include a LoRaWAN module.

## Resources
To learn more about Arduino and start prototyping with it we recommend:

* [Getting Started with Arduino and Genuino products](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)
* [Foundations](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations)

We also recommend the [Grove Starter kit](http://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Starter-kit-for-Arduino%26Genuino-101-p-2664.html) to make working with sensors easier.
