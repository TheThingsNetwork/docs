The Things Stack Community Edition supports the [LoRa Basics Station LNS protocol](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html). LNS establishes a data connection between Basics Station and The Things Stack Community Edition, and is preferred over the legacy UDP Packet Forwarder.

Some of the advantages of Basics Station over the legacy UDP Packet Forwarder are:

- Centralized Update and Configuration Management
- TLS and Token-based Authentication
- Centralized Channel-Plan Management
- No Dependency on Local Time Keeping
