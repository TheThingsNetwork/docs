### Data API

The Data API allow you to receive events and messages from devices as well as send messages to devices.

You can work with the Data API using [SDKs](.././sdks.md) or directly through [MQTT](.././mqtt/index.md).

### Application Manager API

The Application Manager API lets you manage applications, gateways and devices.

You can work with the Application Manager API using [SDKs](.././sdks.md) or directly through [HTTP](.././manager/index.md).
