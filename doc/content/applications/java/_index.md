# Java SDK

[Java](https://www.java.com) is a complete ecosystem that provides tools for developing software and deploying it in a cross-platform environment.

With the [TTN Client](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/java-app-sdk) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages.


*⚠️ The support and maintenance for this SDK has been discontinued, it is not recommended to use the SDK for new projects.*
