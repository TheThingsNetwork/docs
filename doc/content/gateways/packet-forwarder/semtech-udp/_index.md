The Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder is the **first packet forwarder**, connecting to servers through the [Semtech UDP protocol]({{< relref "../../start/connection/#semtech-udp-protocol" >}}). Although this protocol has several flaws, many gateways include a pre-compiled version of the packet forwarder, which makes it easy to test a gateway with this protocol.

## Installation

Many gateways (Multitech Conduit, LORIX One...) include a pre-compiled version of this packet forwarder. For other gateways, the code is [available online](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder), and can be compiled with Semtech's [LoRa library](https://github.com/Lora-net/lora_gateway).

## Configuration

When the packet forwarder starts, it looks in the current directory for a `global_conf.json`, a `local_conf.json` and a `debug_conf.json`. If `debug_conf.json` exists, the other files are ignored - otherwise, the parameters in `local_conf.json` override those in `global_conf.json`.

### Registration

Before starting the packet forwarder, it is wiser to [register the gateway in the console]({{< relref "../../registration/#via-udp-packet-forwarder" >}}) first, using its **unique EUI**.

### EUI configuration

Once the registration is complete, add the **gateway EUI** in the `local_conf.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway_conf": {
    "gateway_ID": "<Gateway EUI>"
  }
}
```

### Router configuration

After that, edit the `global_conf.json` file to point to the router. If you're using the The Things Stack Sandbox, you will need to add the **address of the router region** - for example, for the EU region, it will be `router.eu.thethings.network`. Otherwise, it will be the hostname of your **router** - most of the time, it is just the hostname of your network.

Unless you're running the network yourself on specific ports, the **ports** will be 1700 and 1700.

```json
{
  [...]
  "gateway_conf": {
    "server_address": "router.eu.thethings.network",
    "serv_port_up": 1700,
    "serv_port_down": 1700,
    [...]
  }
}
```
