title: Single-channel gateways
weight: 100

Single-channel gateways are low-cost devices that can be used to start exploring the LoRa world. They can receive LoRa packets on a specific spreading factor and channel, and exchange them back and forth with the network. Because they're financially accessible, many users have started to build their own single-channel gateways to experiment with LoRa.

We **do not recommend** starting to set up gateways by setting up single-channel gateways. Single-channel gateways are not LoRaWAN-compliant and only offer poor coverage. For this reason, we have chosen to hide single-channel gateways from our gateway map. If you want to start exploring the LoRaWAN world without investing too much, we would rather recommend investing in a [Things Gateway]({{< relref "../../gateway/" >}}) or [building your own gateway]({{< relref "../build" >}}), which are beneficial to the whole community!
