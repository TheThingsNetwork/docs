Radio propagation describes how the radio signals travel from the transmitter to the receiver inside the earth's atmosphere or free space.

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight (LoS) is a type of propagation that can transmit and receive data only where the transmitter and receiver are in view of each other without any obstacles between them. Even in the LoS, the signal strength gets reduced when it passes through the air for a long distance.

## Attenuation

Attenuation is the loss of signal strength during transmission because of the absorption by various obstacles/materials.

Here is some approximate attenuation at 900 MHz:

- Glass: 2dB
- Brick: 5dB
- Masonry brick: 12dB
- Reinforced concrete: 27dB

## Knife-edge Diffraction

This type of propagation happens a lot in urban environments. A building or a mountain may block the transmitter and receiver antennas creating a shadow zone. These buildings and mountains act as knife edges. When the signal passes over the knife-edge at the top of the building or mountain it is diffracted into the shadow zone. This will usually provide spotty coverage, however, this is important to urban propagation to offer more coverage.

## Tropo-scatter

Air in the troposphere contains enough particles up to 10 km. They reliably scatter (throw in various random directions) a small number of radio signals back down to earth. For example, with the scattering, a 900 MHz signal can reach up to 800 km away which is beyond the radio horizon.

## Reflection

Cities are a good example of such an environment. Obstacles like buildings reflect signals and create multiple paths for the signals to follow. Buildings made out of good conductors reflect nearly all the energy of the signals. However, insulators such as glass, brick walls, and concrete, reflect less energy, allowing the remaining energy to penetrate through. Reflections are often allowed to get signals even in dense urban environments. As radio waves are reflected, they will create both constructive and destructive interference.
