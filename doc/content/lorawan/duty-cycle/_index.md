**Duty Cycle indicates the fraction of time a resource is busy.**

When a single device transmits on a channel for 2 _time units_ every 10 _time units_, this device has a duty cycle of 20%.

However, if we also consider _channels_, things get a bit more complicated. When we have a device that transmits on 3 channels instead of one, each individual _channel_ is still occupied for 2 _time units_ every 10 _time units_ (so 20%). However, the _device_ is now transmitting for 6 _time units_ every 10 _time units_, giving it a duty cycle of 60%.

In our European frequency plan, we have channels in different _sub-bands_, so when considering the duty cycle, we also have to consider these. Let's say the 3 channels we used before, are in 2 different _sub-bands_. Each separate _channel_ still has a duty cycle of 20%, the _device_ still has a duty cycle of 60%, but we now see that _Band 1_ is in use for 2 _time units_ every 10 _time units_ (20%), while _Band 2_ is in use for 4 _time units_ every 10 _time units_ (40%).

## Maximum Duty Cycle

The duty cycle of radio devices is often regulated by government. If this is the case, the duty cycle is commonly set to 1%, but make sure to check the regulations of your local government to be sure.

In Europe, duty cycles are regulated by section 4.3.3 of the [ETSI EN300.220-2 V3.2.1 (2018-06)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300200_300299/30022002/03.02.01_60/en_30022002v030201p.pdf) standard. This standard defines the following sub-bands and their duty cycles:

- **K** (863 MHz - 865 MHz): 0.1%
- **L** (865 MHz - 868 MHz): 1%
- **M** (868 MHz - 868.6 MHz): 1%
- **N** (868.7 MHz - 869.2 MHz): 0.1%
- **P** (869.4 MHz - 869.65 MHz): 10%
- **Q** (869.7 MHz - 870 MHz): 1%

Additionally, the LoRaWAN specification specifies duty cycles for the join frequencies, which are used for over-the-air activations (OTAA) by every LoRaWAN-compliant end device. In most regions, the duty cycle for these frequencies is set to **1%**.

#### Fair Use Policy

On The Things Network's The Things Stack Sandbox a **Fair Use Policy** applies which limits the **uplink airtime** to **30 seconds per day (24 hours) per node** and the **downlink messages** to **10 messages per day (24 hours) per node**. If you use a private network, these limits do not apply, but you still have to be compliant with the governmental and LoRaWAN limits.

## Compliance

Every radio device must be compliant with the regulated duty cycle limits. This applies to **both nodes and gateways**.

In practice, this means that you should program your nodes in such a way, that they stay within the limits. The easiest way to do this, is to calculate how much _airtime_ each message consumes using one of the many [airtime calculators](https://avbentem.github.io/airtime-calculator/ttn/eu868) and use that information to choose a good transmit interval.

Some radio modules (such as the RN2483) also enforce the duty cycle limits. If you exceed the limits, the module will complain with a message `no_free_ch`. Specifically, the RN2483 limits the duty cycle on a per-channel basis. This means that if you only have 1 channel configured, the module will start enforcing the duty cycle after the first message.

_The figure below shows enforcement on a resource with a 20% duty cycle limit_

In the European band, a transmission on a channel within a frequency band, also influences the other frequencies in that band.

_The figure below shows enforcement on two bands, each with a 20% duty cycle limit_

As a per-channel duty cycle limit is easier to implement, you can also divide the sub-band duty cycle over the number of channels in that sub-band. So for example, in a sub-band with 8 channels and a duty cycle of 1%, each channel has a duty cycle of 1/8% (that's 0.125%).

This method is also implemented by the RN2483 module, and as a result, instead of seeing the `no_free_ch` when you send too quickly after the first message you can send multiple messages before all 8 channels are "blocked" and the duty cycle is enforced.

_The figure below shows enforcement on those same two bands, but enforced per channel_

_(note: channel 3 is blocked until slot 11)_
